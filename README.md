# Geocode Project

This project is a simple geocoding application that allows users to search for an address and view its geographical location on a map. The application uses the Mapbox API for geocoding and map rendering.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) that includes the application's structure and links to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

## How to Use

To use the application, simply type an address into the input field and click the "Search" button. The geographical coordinates of the address will be displayed, and the location will be marked on the map.

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

- [Bootstrap 5.1.3](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Mapbox GL JS v2.3.1](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/)

## Running the Project
